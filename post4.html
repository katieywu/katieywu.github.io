<h3>GSRGO! The Augmented Reality App</h3>
<p><strong class="pink">The Gist:</strong> For a 4 hour UX/UI hackathon, my teammate and I had to create an app that incorporated Augmented Reality and solve a problem that existed for Penn students. We created an app concept that <strong>helps students locate and book Group Study Rooms (GSRs) in real time.</strong></p>

<p><strong class="pink">The Challenge: </strong>
Since it was such a huge problem to tackle (to improve some aspect of student life), my teammate and I struggled in the beginning. We listed out our own problems through contextual inquiries, but none of them seemed reasonable enough to be identified as a universal “problem.” But we knew that finding a real problem was more important than rushing to a design solution. The problem would make our break our project.</p>

<p><strong class="pink">The Breakthrough: </strong>
After about one hour of struggle, we identified a pattern of students struggling to find study spaces. At Penn you can book </p>

<p><strong class="pink">The Team: </strong>
Due to the short time limit, Howard made most of the slide deck where as I did the wireframes and workflow. </p>

<p><strong class="pink">The Takeaway: </strong>
The biggest takeaway from this project that user-centered design is really "problem driven" instead of “solution driven.” It’s useless to have a good concept without solid user research and a strong problem statement backing it.</p>
