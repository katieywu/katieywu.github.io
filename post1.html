<h3>"condoms!" Android App</h3>
The app that protects Philly from HIV.
<p>
For PennApps XII, I hacked with a team that was passionate about civic hacking. We wanted to do something that made a difference, And with the Open Data Act that Mayer Nutter recently passed, the city of Philadelphia was required to release a massive load of civic data. Among this data was information about all the free condom distribution centers in Philly and ss students in Philadelphia, we take for granted our easy access to free condoms and clinics. However, the rest of Philly isn't quite so lucky. The city-wide concentration of HIV cases is five times the national average.</p>

<p>
Our app aims to connect local Philadelphians with all free condom distribution centers, as well as free HIV clinics. We do this by using Google Maps API to visualize your location and directions to the surrounding clinics/centers. You can also toggle a heat map, showing the areas in Philly with the highest concentration of HIV cases, contrasted with the locations of the free condoms. We also added a touch of humor to lighten the mood of a very serious topic - check out the "Tap Me" tab with randomly generated "sexy" one-liners!</p>
