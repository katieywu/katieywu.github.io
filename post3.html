<h3>Tailors + Madmen</h3>
<!--<h4>Crawling the web, one page at a time.</h4>-->
<p><strong class="pink">The Gist:</strong> As one of four members of the Tailors + Madmen team, I was the principal designer and creative director for our Kickstarter startup, a project focused on creating minimalist and customizable watches. Three good friends approached me to help them develop their brand identity, so I was responsible for driving the project's aesthetic.  and suggesting that we focus on young, working individuals in search of a "classy but affordable" watch. Our project was launched on Kickstarter in Fall 2015. Check out <a href="http://tailorsandmadmen.com/">our website.</a></p>

<h2>Watch Design</h2>
<p>As principal designer I had an enormous amount of input in the design of the watches as well as the general aesthetic. From the graphics that we used to the color of the watches to the types of straps discussed, I played a huge role in shaping how this brand turned out. My teammates were great in giving input as well, but being the only member with an aesthetic background, I spearheaded most of the design.</p>
