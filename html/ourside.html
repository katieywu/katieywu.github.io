<h3>Ourside</h3>
<p><strong class="yellow">The Gist:</strong> Ourside is a Microsoft Hololens app integrated with a Leap Motion controller that allows you to draw in augmented reality using just your fingertips. The name Ourside came from an idea we had about creating a new persistent world on top of our existing one, where each physical space becomes a new medium for shared art and creation.</p>

<p>Developed with Nick Newberg, and Alex Daley-Montgomery in <strong>Unity3D Engine</strong></p>
