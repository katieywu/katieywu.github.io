<h3>Ratchet</h3>
<p><strong class="pink">The Gist:</strong> Ratchet is an asymmetrical multiplayer game on the HTC Vive where a large rat chef (appropriately named Ratchet) must protect his kitchen from a nasty human infestation. One player takes on the role of the humongous chef in VR while the other uses a keyboard and mouse to control the little human (whom we affectionately called Lil' Boy). Lil' Boy must use his wit and agility to dodge Ratchet's hatchet while collecting ingredients for a meal to feed his family. Ratchet must stir his pot to clear steam from the room in order to see his opponent. Lil' Boy can also temporarily blind the chef by shooting raspberries at his face, which blinds the other player in the HTC Vive.</p>
