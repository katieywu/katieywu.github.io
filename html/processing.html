<h3>Happiness Height Map</h3>
<p><strong class="pink">The Gist:</strong> My job was to take data and turn in into something without words - a task proved to be much harder than it seemed. I used Processing to visualize my happiness as a 3D height map, and from there I printed this visualization out and used it as material with which I created my paper armor. </p>

<p>
Starting from data, I recorded how I felt each hour at a new location, and using that I created a 2D image that had my peak happiness as brighter dots on a map of Philadelphia, and my sadness as blacker dots on the map. I then turned this 2D image into a huge, 3D scene using blob detection, where the white spots became the peaks, and the black spots became troughs. The final product was a file that was fully in 3D and that you could pan around, viewing the map from all angles. And even though I had to pick a few angles to print out for the base of my "armor," it was quite an amazing moment when I hit "Run" and I created something so visually interesting with a few lines of simplified Java. Check out the original grayscale heightmap at the bottom of this page!</p>
