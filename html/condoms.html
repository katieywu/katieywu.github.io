<h3>"condoms!" Android App</h3>
<p><strong class="yellow">The Gist:</strong> For PennApps XII (2015), I hacked with a team that was passionate about civic hacking. We wanted to do something that made a difference, And with the Open Data Act that Mayer Nutter recently passed, the city of Philadelphia was required to release a massive load of civic data. Among this data was information about all the free condom distribution centers in Philly and as students in Philadelphia, we take for granted our easy access to free condoms and clinics. However, the rest of Philly isn't so lucky. The city-wide concentration of HIV cases is five times the national average.</p>

<p>
Our app aims to <strong>connect local Philadelphians with free condom distribution centers</strong>, as well as free HIV clinics. We do this by using <strong>Google Maps API</strong> to visualize your location and directions to the surrounding clinics/centers. You can also toggle a heat map, showing the areas in Philly with the highest concentration of HIV cases, contrasted with the locations of the free condoms. We also added a touch of humor to lighten the mood of a very serious topic - check out the "Tap Me" tab with randomly generated one-liners!</p>

<p>Made with <strong>Android Studio</strong> and prototyped with Sketch.app and Framer.js</p>

<p><strong class="yellow">Prototype:</strong> Because we were running out of time and could not get the Android UI to look like what we wanted, we also created a fully interactive prototype to convey the look of our app. This prototype is NOT the real Android app, which does interface with Google Maps API as well as do more complication backend work. Check it out below! If the embedded prototype is not being responsive, here is a <a href="http://share.framerjs.com/je890g709068/">direct link</a> to the prototype, as well as our <a href="http://devpost.com/software/protectphilly">DevPost</a>.</p>
